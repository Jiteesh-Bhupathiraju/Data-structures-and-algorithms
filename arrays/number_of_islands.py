# again the logic comes from the DFS, to nullify any found 1's in horizontal or vertical
# increment by 1 and carry on for all

# the nullifier can be done in mltiple ways
# better is to while till we find a zero and stop for that row and column

# need to make sure not stuck in a loop; so defining a direction is better

# works and better: have the possible directions list and recur
